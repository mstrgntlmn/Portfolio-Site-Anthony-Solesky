          <h2>The Problemo</h2>
          <p>Alright dudes and dudettes, let’s face it. Banks can be a total bummer.
            There’s got to be a way to manage your money that’s simple, friendly,
            and available for anyone, anytime, anywhere. And is it too much to ask
            for low fees? It’s your money after all!</p>

          <p>Vapor Wallet provides the ability to make secure, encrypted transactions
            from anywhere in the world, and freely convert between international
            currencies. While digital wallets have become the trend these days, few
            if any provide service outside of their home country and feature tools to
            help promote financial intelligence. Vapor Wallet will give financial
            control back to the people.</p>

          <h2>You can’t yada yada research...</h2>
          <p>In order to ensure a most excellent experience for our users, the
            design process began by gathering information using a variety of
            research methods.
          </p>
          <p>The process began with a competitive analysis of several popular
            digital finance services, including PayPal and Cash App.
          </p>
          <p>After determining the strengths and weakness of competitors, I
            pin-pointed areas of opportunity within the market. One such defecit
            was a severe lack of support outside of these apps’ home countries,
            as well as tools to help users learn to better manage finances.
          </p>
          <p>Armed with this information, I performed a series of user interviews
            and surveys, focusing questions on spending, travel, and budgeting
            habits.

        <div>
          <p>I was able to distill a basic list of features that were most
            wanted by my user pool:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A way for users to make Payments - to other users and vendors</li>
            <li>A live Currency Converter, built into the Payment Tool</li>
            <li>A Budgeting Tool that allows users to monitor spending - for
              monthly expenses, trips abroad, special events, etc. Bonus points
              for incentivizing users to actually use it.</li>
            <li>The ability to set up Direct Deposit from an employer without an
              external bank account</li>
            <li>Provide users with a physical Debit Card linked to their Vapor
              Wallet - for ATM access and in-store purchases</li>
            <li>Investing tools and tips</li>
            <li>A way to view Transaction History for purchases made and payments
              received within Vapor Wallet</li>
            <li>Simple, intuitive navigation</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h2>Just go with the flow!</h2>
          <p>With a list of features in hand, it was time to map out our
            navigation with some user flows. Remembering that we need to keep
            things simple, I went with a flat menu topography for my top-level
            navigation. The goal was to limit the number of actions the user
            had to perform in order to perform all the major tasks as much as
            possible.

          <p>Finally it was time to work up some wireframes for both mobile and
            desktop, run usability testing with users, and rework those into
            prototypes for further testing.
          </p>

            <h2>Iterative UI Design</h2>
            <p>As you may have already noticed, Vapor Wallet’s aesthetic takes us
              back to the 90’s.
            </p>
            <p>Why the 90’s? Good question.
            </p>
            <p>When I first approached the concept of designing a financial app,
              my initial thought was Art Deco. Heavily tied to the 1920’s, Art
              Deco will always have associations with banking, money, prosperity.
              But that’s old money. Your dad’s money. Vapor Wallet is about your
              money.
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to do something fresh and fun with the UI.
            </p>
            <p>So I jumped ahead to another more recent decade associated with
              excess: the 80’s.
            </p>
            <p>While it was a lot of fun playing with different styles and motifs
              from the neon decade, and I received positive feedback on the designs,
              there was always something that didn’t feel right...
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>My first pass felt like a caricature.
            </p>
            <p>While I liked some of the colors, it just didn’t feel genuine to
              me, like I was trying too hard.
            </p>
            <p>The background was also very busy and a bit distracting.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Here I was getting closer.
            </p>
            <p>As a kid, I remember flipping through the check catalogues,
              looking at all the different designs, and actually thinking how
              cool it will be when I get old enough to have a bank account and
              order checks of my own.
            </p>
            <p>This design was inspired by those check catalogues. But again,
              it was just too busy, and it was still missing something. I
              wasn’t connecting with the design.

            <p>I took a step back on this iteration and looked at some other
              financial app designs. I really did like the minimal design
              and the color palette here, but I still wanted to do something
              different for this project. Something eye-catching that
              wouldn’t get lost in the fold.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>One of my biggest takeaways from this project was the ability to
              let go. I had to learn not to be attached to any part of my design
              as it could change completely from one iteration to the next based
              on how testing went.
            </p>
            <p>I feel like my experience participating in game jams helped a lot
              with prototyping, as those types of events are all about creating a
              minimum viable product as quickly as possible, usually within 48
              hours. What was a nice change from that type of design work was the
              ability to actually perform all of the pre-production steps that you
              simply don’t have time for.
            </p>
            <p>I also learned what research methods help me most in my design
              process. For example, user interviews were fundamental in
              determining what features to include, but I did not find that the
              creation of detailed personas really contributed much to the final
              design.
            </p>
            <p>In the end, I learned to let go of my expectations for the
              project and let the data drive my design. I didn’t allow myself
              to become attached to any piece unless I had quantifiable evidence
              to justify its inclusion.
            </p>
            <p>I had a great time working on Vapor Wallet, and I hope you
              enjoyed following along with my journey.
